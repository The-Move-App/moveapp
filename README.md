# Installing NodeJS and NPM

In order for us to be able to install React-Native and Expo-Cli, we need to install NodeJS and NPM. The documentation link is: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm which provides the resource to properly install NodeJS and NPM.

# Installing Xcode or Android Studio:

In order to run the code, we need to install an app development environment. For Mac OS X users it is best to install Xcode. For Windows users only Android Studio can be installed. Mac OS X users are the only ones able to install both Xcode and Android Studio.

# Setting Up The Development Environment: 

We now need to set up the environment for React Native. The Documentation for setting up the environment can be found here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
``` npm install -g expo-cli ``` 



expo init MoveApp

cd move-app
npm start # you can also use: expo start

Must install in terminal:
``` npm install react-native-gesture-handler ```
``` npm install react-navigation  ```
``` npm install react-native-elements ```
``` npm install @react-navigation/native   ```
